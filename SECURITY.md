## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not report security issues through public GitHub issues.

Use one of these private channels instead:

- GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting
- Email: **kirillsurov0@gmail.com**

Reports may be submitted in English or Russian.

To help with triage, please include:

- Affected version
- Runtime or environment details
- Reproduction steps
- Sample input or data
- Impact description
- Whether worker mode was enabled, disabled, or unavailable
- Any known mitigation or workaround

## What is likely in scope

Issues that may be security-relevant include:

- Algorithmic denial of service from specially crafted large inputs with realistic exploit potential
- Excessive CPU or memory consumption with realistic exploit potential
- Worker message handling issues with real security impact
- Package publishing or supply-chain compromise
- Confirmed vulnerable dependencies that can affect consumers of the package

## What is usually out of scope

The following are usually out of scope unless they create a real security impact:

- Imperfect masonry balancing
- Incorrect column distribution
- Normal validation failures for invalid input
- Rendering differences between environments
- Errors caused by non-cloneable `meta` values in worker mode
- API misunderstandings around `recreate({ ... })` with omitted `items` or `sort(source)` semantics
- Direct imports of internal build artifacts or other non-exported files
- Documentation bugs, API ergonomics issues, or feature requests
- Environment-specific worker setup problems without a security consequence

## Response process

The maintainer will try to:

- Acknowledge receipt within 7 days
- Investigate and validate the report
- Prepare a fix or mitigation when needed
- Coordinate responsible disclosure

## Disclosure

Please avoid public disclosure until the issue has been investigated and, when possible, fixed.
